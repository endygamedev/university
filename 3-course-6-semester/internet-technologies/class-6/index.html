                The so-called absolute units (cm, mm, in, pt and pc) mean the same in CSS as everywhere else, but only if your output device has a high enough resolution. On a laser printer, 1cm should be exactly 1 centimeter. But on low-resolution devices, such as computer screens, CSS doesn't require that. And indeed, the result tends to be different from one device to another and from one CSS implementation to another. It's better to reserve these units for high-resolution devices and in particular for printed output. On computer screens and handheld devices, you'll probably not get what you expect.
